        "text": "I grew up in metro Detroit making this pizza long before anyone called it \u201cDetroit-style.\u201d At Woodward, we stay true to that tradition: every pizza is baked in seasoned steel pans that give it a crisp bottom and light, airy interior. We spread the cheese all the way to the edges for the caramelized frico crust, then finish with warm sauce on top after the bake. It\u2019s the same style I remember from back home, now shared here in Edmond and the OKC metro."

When our daughter was a newborn, she had a minor dairy allergy, so we understand the need firsthand. At Woodward Pizza we offer dairy-free cheese and plenty of fresh toppings, and many of our pizzas can be customized into a dairy-free pizza without losing any of the flavor. Our goal is to make sure everyone \u2014 whether you\u2019re local to Edmond or visiting the OKC metro \u2014 can enjoy a great slice together."

I spent over 9 months researching and developing our gluten-free dough, determined to make it almost indistinguishable from our standard Detroit-style pizza. The result is light, fluffy, crisp, and deep \u2014 just like the square pizzas I grew up on. Our original business partner has celiac disease, and when he tried it for the first time he told me it was the best gluten-free pizza he\u2019d ever had. To go with it, we also keep gluten-free cider on tap and carry gluten-free beer. In our kitchen we take extra precautions: a separate mixer for gluten-free dough, different pans, and we prepare the dough later in the day so regular flour dust has time to settle. While we can\u2019t guarantee a completely flour-free environment, we do everything possible to minimize cross-contact and create a safe, delicious option for guests with gluten sensitivity."

And of course, a scoop of gelato usually solves everything.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Do you have a lunch special?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Yes — we offer a weekday lunch special, Monday through Friday from 11:00am to 2:00pm. It’s designed to be quick and satisfying, with options like a classic cheese or pepperoni square, our rotating slice of the day, or pairings such as slice and half salad or even a salad and meatball combo. It’s the perfect way to enjoy Detroit-style pizza (or a lighter option) on your lunch break in Edmond or the OKC metro.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Do you sell pizza by the slice?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Yes — we serve up Detroit-style pizza by the slice during our weekday lunch hours, Monday through Friday from 11:00am to 2:00pm. The slice of the day changes, so it’s your chance to cheat on your go-to pizza and try something new without committing to a whole pan.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Do you offer online ordering?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Yes — you can order Woodward Pizza online for pickup or delivery right from our website. In fact, our online menu has even more options than our in-store menu — kind of like a cheat code or secret menu for pizza fans. Whether it’s lunch, family dinner, or game night, online ordering makes it quick and easy to get your Detroit-style favorites.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Where can I park when visiting Woodward Pizza?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Parking is easy when you visit us at the Icehouse Project. There’s a shared parking lot right by the building, but even if the lot is full, we still have plenty of seating — especially on the patio. You can also park in the adjoining street spots or walk over from the Farmers Market parking just down the way.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Can I order Woodward Pizza while I’m at American Solera?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Yes! If you’re hanging out at American Solera next door, you can order from our menu right at your table using the QR codes. Place your order, and we’ll bring your Detroit-style pizza over to you so you can enjoy a craft beer with a hot pizza without ever leaving your seat.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Can I order from the patio?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Yes! Whether you’re feeling impatient or just enjoying your conversation with that blind date, you can order straight from your patio table. Just scan the QR code on the table, select your table number, and place your order. We’ll bring your food right out to you so you never have to leave your seat.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Do you offer catering or large orders?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Yes — we’ve got you covered whether it’s a family gathering, an office lunch, or feeding the whole football team. From Detroit-style square pizzas to salads and sides, we can put together a spread that keeps everyone happy. Just give us a call ahead of time so we can plan and have it ready for your crew.</p></div></details>
<details class="faq-item"><summary>Do you have a happy hour?</summary><div class="answer"><p>Yes — we actually have two happy hours every Monday through Friday: from 2:00–6:00pm and again from 8:30–10:00pm. It’s the perfect time to stop by for a cocktail or a beer to pair with your Detroit-style pizza.</p></div></details>
